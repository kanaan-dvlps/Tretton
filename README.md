# Tretton Test API

### Technologies
- Node.js
- MongoDB (database)
- mongoose (ODM)
- JWT (authentication)
- axios (to request to other APIs)
- Joi (to validate entry data)
- body-parser
- dotenv (for reading .env files)
- you can checkout the package.json file for more info about the project

### Run the app
- you can use `pm2 start server.js --watch` if you have pm2 installed or `nodemon server.js` if you have nodemon or `node server.js` if you want to stay old school to run the application

- you need to have an **.env** file to run the app, there's no default variables for this app
- since this won't be as a security issue and for the sake of speed I'll mention the keys that are comming from .env file and you can set whatever value you like to run the environment

```
\\ .env sample
BASE_URL=http://<YOUR_HOST_BASE_URL>:<PORT>
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://<MONGO_HOST>:<MONGO_PORT>/<YOUR_DB_NAME>
PORT=<YOUR_PORT>
SECRET=<YOUR_SECRET_SALT>

```

## Scraper part
- The scraper will run when you enter `/api/coworkers` API
- The scraper helper will run and fetch all the necessary data to match the **coworkers schema** that we have and fill up the database
- It will look for the chnages that have happened in the DOM and if the data is changed it will save them/it and if there's no change it won't do anything
# The **Text** part
- I've already gathered names while traversing and scraping the DOM and the profile urls are something like `tretton37.com/meet/<THE_COWORKER_NAME>`
- So I decided to eliminate the whitespaces and replace them with dashes and append a /meet behind it
- Now I have pushed them in an array to have an array of urls and then I'll turn that array into smaller arrays so that when I use them I can turn my API calls into more managed chunks of data
- Now there should be a way to call those APIs in an async type of request, meaning they should be done in the backgeround and update the database if needed
- Or we should call the APIs in a way that it is resource efficient.
- the like other data that we have extracted we need to extract the **text** of each person.

## APIs documentation
[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/5766928-c70bc408-96b0-4261-a673-4ce3627a991b?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D5766928-c70bc408-96b0-4261-a673-4ce3627a991b%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D69fbea48-96bc-4344-b940-2ea2b7e62738)

- you can proceed to see the documentation via the the postman button
- if needed please fork the collection
- then on the left side go to workspace and choose *Tretton Test | Kanaan Bahmani*
- **or you can use this link as well:** `https://www.postman.com/KanaanBahmani/workspace/tretton37-test-kanaan-bahmani/collection/5766928-c70bc408-96b0-4261-a673-4ce3627a991b?ctx=documentation`

- **Please note that:** for the sake of showing how the *authentication* works I've included the auth middleware to the **getCoworker.js** file in the route `/api/coworker` you need to include oyur token like: `Authorization <your_token>`

- you can generate a token in `/api/login`, you need to send it an arbitery username like:
- you can read in more detail about token generation in the login section

``` 
 {
   "username": "kanaan"
 }

```

- and you will be provided with a token

### Get Coworker
- This route is for fetching a single coeorker, you need to send the coworker's id in the url params in orther to be able to fetch that coworker's info.

- you need to be authorised in order to proceed with this route and for that matter you can send your token that you received from `/api/login` in the header as follows:

```
{
  key: Authorization | value: <YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE>
}
```
- the `url` will look like this: `http://localhost:<PORT>/api/coworker/:id`
- instead of the `:id` at the end of the route you need to send the coworker's id of your choice that you wanna see.

```
// example of response body object that you'll recieve
responseBody: {
  "name": "Kanaan Bahmani",
  "text": "I love to join tretton",
  "imagePortraitUrl": "https://i.1337co.de/profile/alexander-olsson-medium"
}

```

### Get Coworkers
- this route is for fetching all the coworkers, it receives 3 query strings in the url:
- url example: `http://localhost:9000/api/coworkers?start=6&end=5&filter=lu`
- this url above will skip 6 documents and show 5 documents per request, and also will implement the characters I've used to do a filtration on database based on name, city, and country and any of them that can match any of these characters will be returned as results.

```
// example of response body object that you'll recieve
responseBody: {

I began writing some basic programs when I was 10 years old, which led me to think that I was going to study computer science when finishing high school - no questions asked. However, during my high school years I started to develop a keen interest for both the mathematical and the social sciences and all of a sudden, it was not so easy for me to decide what area to pursue after high school.</p><p>Finally, I ended up with a Bachelor degree in Mathematics with a specialisation in numerical analysis. Even though I had fallen head over heels in love with mathematics and programming, I was still wondering if I had made the right choice. </p><p>I decided that the only way to figure out what I truly wanted to do for the rest of my life was to try and see what the other side had to offer. I began working in the service and banking industry for a couple of years while giving law school a try. I found law to be a fascinating subject on its own, but realised after some time that my heart truly belonged to mathematics and software development.</p><p>Besides the problem solving skills I developed during my time studying mathematics, I truly believe that my non-traditional background is one of the greatest strengths I possess. I dare say that I have truly lived outside the box, and have thus gained experiences that will benefit me to a great extent, both as an individual but also in my work as a developer.</p><p>In my free time, when I&apos;m not tinkering with Haskell and other functional languages, you can find me outside running long distances or inside working my way through my ever growing &quot;books-to-read&quot; list.</p> ",

The way computers back then invited for curiosity to interact in different ways is the foundation that drives me to constantly enjoy new technology.</p><p>I have a strong passion for code and programming but what I value the most is the outcome - the interface that the users interacts with. As much as the browser landscape can be painful, I also embrace it. It&apos;s what once allowed me to be creative with frames, tables and spacer gifs and today utilising modern javascript (ES6), html and css.</p><p>Outside of digital life I enjoy playing with my three kids. To keep up with their energy I&apos;ve become somewhat obsessed by long distance running. I&apos;ve tried a couple of marathons and ultra marathons.

- #### skip
- Use this to tell the database how many documents to skip

- #### limit
- Use this to tell how many documents to show every time of getting the results back

- #### filter
- Use this to do filteration based on name, city, and country on the results
- filteration is case-insensitive so don't worry :)

### Edit Coworker
- Use this API to edit coworker's name, city, and text.
- API route: `/api/update/:id`
- you can send the id of the coworker you wish to update its information
- you can edit name, city, and text all at once or only one of them you wish to edit.

```
// request body example
{
  "name": string,
  "city": string,
  "text": string
}
```
```
// responce body example
{
  "updatedModel": {
    "_id": "6158e0e494fa041a2c31e288",
    "name": "Kanaan Bahmani",
    "country": "ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª",
    "city": "Lund",
    "text": "I love to join tretton",
    "imagePortraitUrl": "https://i.1337co.de/profile/amin-yosoh-medium",
    "__v": 0
  }
}
```
### Login
- use this API to get a token via this url: `/api/login`

```
// request body example
{
  "username": string
}
```

```
// response object example
{
  eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJwYXlsb2FkIjoia2FuYWFuIGJhaG1hbmkiLCJpYXQiOjE2MzM1MTg3MDQsImV4cCI6MTYzNDgxNDcwNH0.hHyqFDP3899VpkL_9MHqvYp824ghGdnlk4aCeDYszxM
}
```

### Scraper file
- this file is there to fill up your database, it's not containerized as was asked in the test, however it does the job and it will only run once to just fill up the database it won't even update the database

- if you want to test it out you can use this url: `/api/scrap/coworkers`
- the response object is 200+ coworkers info that was provided in this link `https://tretton37-assignment-frontend.herokuapp.com/api/coworkers?`

- this could be an automated thing that would get even notified whenever there was a change in the tretton's database and then update the database.

### JWT file
- this file is a middleware for JWT to verify our token that is being sent in the `req.headers['authorization']`.
- if it can verify the token then it's accepted and the user is authorized to perform the action if not they will be sent a message like so:

```
// error response example
// error code of 401
{
  codeMessage: 'Unauthorized',
  response: error.message // what ever the error is will be send back
}
```
- if the user didn't provide a token they will be shown a meesage like so:
```
// error response example
// error code of 403
{
  'Token is required'
}
```
### Token file
- this is a helper file to create our token
- the token expires in 15 days
- the token secret should be provided inside the .env file

### Coworker Schema file
- this is our coworker's model made with `mongoose.Schema`, our model looks like:
```
{
  name: string
  country: string
  city: string
  text: string
  imagePortraitUrl: string
}
```
